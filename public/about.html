<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I started my career as a Chinese language translator and localizer. I worked as a Chinese Webnovel localizer before, which is a chinese online novel, and eventually became a Game Translator and localizer for various Chinese and local games, translating and localizing from Chinese to Indonesian, Indonesian to Chinese, and English to chinese. I began to have interest in coding because I've encountered many simple tags and HTML elements inside the game texts and translation data, which I consider very unique because gaming field require me to translate documents mixed with tag elements. My job is to make sure that I can retain the correct meaning of the words and arranging them with the tags in the right order, so they can function properly inside the game. I also conduct LQA, it's a process to find errors or mistypes in translation by playing the game directly and put them inside report.</p>

<p>I started to learn programming from a course package in Udemy, and I hope I can become a good programmer and get a programming-related job in the near future. In the process of learn programming, I realized that my literature background assist me a lot, because I also learn syntaxes and logics from my language major, similar to programming. I also noticed that having a literature background give me advantage to focused on little details (grammar, punctuations, typos, formatting, spacing), which helped me a lot in coding to avoid mistypes. Attention to details is such a valuable skill when it comes to learn languages, including programming languages.</p>
